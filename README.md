# IPMEDT3
Project on VR, build with A-Frame
This project is part of a studycourse on WebVR. The code is written in A-Frame, an HTML framework developed by Mozilla.
In the VR experience you see the world through the eyes of someone suffering from hyperdistraction, a characteristic from autism. We have all respect for people suffering from autism and some were also consulted during the development of this project.

Please note that Dutch is the language used inside of the experience, however most effects are implicational and carry the same meaning regardless of language.
